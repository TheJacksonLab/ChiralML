# Predictive and Interpretable Data-Driven Framework for Deciphering Chiral Emergence of Conjugated Polymers

This repository provides the supporting code and analysis data for the PNAS
manuscript *Predictive and
Interpretable Data-Driven Framework for Deciphering Chiral Emergence of
Conjugated Polymers*. It contains experimental records, polymer information,
a data-processing example, analysis-ready features, and figure-reproduction
notebooks.

Manuscript DOI: `DOI_PLACEHOLDER` (to be added upon publication).

## Experimental data

- [`experimental_data/Supporting_Information.docx`](experimental_data/Supporting_Information.docx): Supporting Information containing the
  experimental methods and dataset in Section S1, Table S1. The table lists
  polymer names, solvents, temperatures, concentrations, assembly outcomes
  (`c`: chiral; `i`: isotropic; `a`: aggregated), and data sources. As explained
  in the SI, repeated CD measurements under the same conditions are retained separately.
- [`experimental_data/Polymer_Information.xlsx`](experimental_data/Polymer_Information.xlsx):
  Polymer information for descriptor construction. The `molecular Information`
  sheet contains 71 polymer records, including molecular weights (Mn and Mw),
  dispersity (PDI), and manually curated counts of side-chain and backbone
  atoms, bonds, branches, rings, and structural units. Structural counts are
  defined per polymer repeating unit. Family and source information are also
  provided where recorded.

These files document the experimental records and polymer-level inputs to
feature generation. The processed feature matrices and per-record absolute
g-factor labels used by the analysis notebooks are provided separately in
`data_analysis/data/analysis_data.xlsx`; the labels are in `Exp_ML_metadata`.

## Feature generation

[`feature_generation/Feature_Generation.ipynb`](feature_generation/Feature_Generation.ipynb)
is a single-data-point example of the feature-generation workflow. The user
supplies polymer and solvent structures, experimental conditions, molecular
weights, manually curated side-chain and backbone counts, and a COSMO-RS
solvation free energy. The notebook calculates RDKit and FASTSOLV descriptors,
applies molecular-weight normalization and family one-hot encoding, and returns
the 77 features used by the machine-learning workflow in a fixed order. Its
last section compares the generated values with a reference row.

Temperature is entered in degrees C and converted to K. Concentration is entered in
mg/mL. A second solvent and a second side chain are optional. The COSMO-RS
value is an external input and is not calculated by this notebook.

### Processing environment

The pipeline was prepared with Python 3.12 and requires:

- NumPy
- pandas
- RDKit
- FASTSOLV 1.0.1
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

FASTSOLV must have access to its pretrained checkpoints. Run all notebook cells
in order after editing the two input sections.

## Data analysis

[`data_analysis/data/analysis_data.xlsx`](data_analysis/data/analysis_data.xlsx)
contains the analysis-ready data used by all three figure notebooks:

- `Exp_ML_features`: 773 experimental rows with features.
- `Exp_ML_metadata`: labels and experimental metadata aligned by
  `experiment_id`.
- `All_Combination_features`: 3,124 feature combinations used for RF
  prediction and the extended FASTSOLV map.

The classification workflow trains on the labeled experimental features.
Figure 6c uses the all-combination features for both prediction and
plotting. Generated PNG files are written to
`data_analysis/figures/`.

### Analysis environment

The analysis notebooks were tested with Python 3.12.3 and require:

- NumPy 2.1.2
- pandas 2.3.2
- Matplotlib 3.10.5
- scikit-learn 1.7.1
- SHAP 0.48.0
- Pillow 11.0.0
- openpyxl 3.1.5
- Jupyter Notebook 7.4.7 and ipykernel 6.30.1

### Analysis notebooks

- [`Figure4.ipynb`](data_analysis/notebooks/Figure4.ipynb) reproduces Figure
  4b-d: the absolute g-factor distribution, repeated grouped out-of-fold
  precision-recall curves, and grouped out-of-fold regression parity plot.
- [`Figure6.ipynb`](data_analysis/notebooks/Figure6.ipynb) reproduces Figure
  6a-e: the combined SHAP plot, experimental FASTSOLV assembly map, RF
  prediction map, outcome fractions, and family-level FASTSOLV summary.
- [`Figure7.ipynb`](data_analysis/notebooks/Figure7.ipynb) reproduces Figure
  7a-d: Thiophene- and NDI-family SHAP plots, Thiophene-family outcome
  fractions, and the N2200 concentration series in chlorobenzene.
